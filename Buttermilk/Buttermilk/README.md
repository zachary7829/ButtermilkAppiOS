# ButtermilkAppiOS
The iOS/iPadOS/macOS version of the buttermilk app.

# What is this?
ButtermilkAppiOS is a libbuttermilk frontend that is built with UIKit in Objective-C/C. This version of ButtermilkApp is exclusively for iOS/iPadOS, although macOS will soon be supported.  This will *not* be for Windows/Linux, rather a completely different libbuttermilk frontend will be developed for those (if I get around to it, of course).

# Open Source
This project as well as Buttermilk itself are open sourced under GPLv3, as well as uses my SeaJson and SeaXML libraries which are open sourced under MIT.
